# ImageResizer

ImageResizer is a Python script that utilizes the OpenCV library (`cv2`) to resize images. This script allows users to specify the source image file, destination file, and the percentage by which the image should be scaled.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Additionally, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to install the OpenCV library. You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subhranil002/ImageResizer.git
```
2. Ensure you have the source image file (`example.jpeg`) in the same directory as the script.
3. Update the configurable parameters as needed in the script:
   - `source`: The filename of the source image.
   - `destination`: The filename of the resized image.
   - `scale_percent`: The percentage by which the image should be scaled.
4. Run the script:

```bash
python ImageResizer.py
```

5. The resized image will be saved as specified in the `destination` variable.
